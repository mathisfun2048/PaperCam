So I'm in the middle of my LightBox project (which you should totally check out too!) and I got this idea of making a digital camera feel more like a instant camera! Right now I'm not really researching parts or anything (focusing more on LightBox) but I wanted to start this and add my sketch so I remember my train of thought!

Spent some time researching various compoennts! The goal for this is to keap cost down adn keep it minimalistic. Spent the rest of the time formating everything in a BOM!
