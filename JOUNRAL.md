So I'm in the middle of my LightBox project (which you should totally check out too!) and I got this idea of making a digital camera feel more like a instant camera! Right now I'm not really researching parts or anything (focusing more on LightBox) but I wanted to start this and add my sketch so I remember my train of thought!
